* Source Branch
The source branch contains modifications for having a third party that is producing EPR pairs on demand.
The goal is to more closely match experimental settings where the source is triggered by the client, and tries to continuously produce EPR pairs.
Pair production is heralded so that both the client and the server know when it is available.
Features to add are the possibility to adjust the success rate for producing the pair and errors along the fiber.
** UBQC_source
Code for the source
** UBQC_cerver
Code for the server
** UBQC_client
Code for the client
** UBQC_test3
Testing that the produced pair is properly correlated in the computational basis.
